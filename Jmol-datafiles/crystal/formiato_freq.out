 VIBRATIONAL ANALYSIS:
 1) EACH PAIR OF BONDED ATOMS (I.E. WITHIN THEIR VAN DER WAALS DISTANCE) A AND
 B IS EXAMINED TO SEE IF THERE IS A LARGE RELATIVE MOTION BETWEEN THEM.
 2) IF SO, THE AB MOTION IS DECOMPOSED IN THREE COMPONENTS: ALONG A-B(LONG),
 ON THE PLANE CONTAING A THIRD ATOM C (ANG) AND OUT OF THE PLANE (OUT).
 LONG+ANG+OUT=1.
 3) THE MODES ARE CLASSIFIED SO AS: LONG > 0.85 -> STRETCHING (S);
 ANG > 0.85 -> BENDING (B); OTHERWISE -> OTHER (O). TYPE (?) MEANS THE MODE IS
 LIKELY TO BE ROTATIONAL. THE POTENTIAL ENERGY CONTRIBUTION (PEC) IS IN KJ/MOL.
