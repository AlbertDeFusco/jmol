Examples of Topology and Coordinate files from Amber
Files were kindly provided by Dr. Jesús Mendieta, Centro de Biología Molecular, Madrid, Spain

They show the aminoacid residues involved in the catalytic centre of the Ras protein, together with GTP, Mg2+ and three water molecules ([CAT] and 2x [HOH]), in addition to the water box, [WAT], included in the molecular dynamics.

*  Topology file (from Amber):
     - bs.prmtop.gz  
* Coordinate files (from Amber):
     - bs_md1.coord.gz   (steps 1-10)  
     - bs_md2.coord.gz   (steps 11-20) 
     - bs_md3.coord.gz   (steps 21-30)
