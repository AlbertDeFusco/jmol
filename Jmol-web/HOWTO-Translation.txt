    How to translate the Jmol website in an other language
    ------------------------------------------------------

Remark : this document presents a step by step procedure for translating
the Jmol website to an other language (noted [xxxx] in the rest of the document).

1. Find the code for the target language: [xx]
Note : Text in brackets (i.e. []) should be replaced with appropriate 
       information. To obtain more information about codes to use for 
       language names and country names, see "The Java Tutorial"'s 
       Internationalization Trail at java.sun.com
For example, for a French translation, the code should be replaced by : fr

2. If you are interested, please begin with the translation of Jmol itself
(see /src/org/openscience/jmol/Properties/Jmol.properties
 and /src/org/openscience/jmol/ui/JmolPopupWords.properties) and the Jmol doc
(see /doc/source/*.xml).
The files can be found in the Jmol source tree.

3. Add the following line in the file /source/doc/.htaccess :
AddLanguage [xx] .[xx]

4. Add a flag icon for the new language : /source/doc/images/flags/[xx].png
(See /source/docs/images/flags/README.txt for more informations)

5. Add a line in the file /source/doc/language.xml file for the new language.
Use the other languages as an example.

6. In the /build.xml file, add the new language in the all.languages property.

7. Copy the file /source/doc/project_en.xml to /source/doc/project_[xx].xml
and translate it into the new language. Add the following 4 lines in the translated
file to remember from which version this file was translated (for an example, you
can look at /source/doc/project_fr.xml) :
<!--
  [Xxxx] translation 
  Translated from default version : project_en.xml (v [CVS version of project_en.xml])
-->

8. For each index_en.xml file in the /source/doc directory and its subdirectories
copy it to index_[xx].xml and translate it into the new language. Add the following
4 lines in the translated file to remember from which version this file was translated
(for an example, you can look at index_fr.xml) :
<!--
  [Xxxx] translation 
  Translated from default version : index_en.xml (v [CVS version of index_en.xml])
-->

Note: some index_en.xml files (for example in the technotes subdirectory) relies on
several other xml files (antiAliasing_en.xml, ...). Copy each one to the appropriate
name (antiAliasing_[xx].xml) and translate. Also add the 4 lines to remember from
which version this file was translated.

9. For each index.en.html file in the /source/doc directory and its subdirectories
copy it to index.[xx].html and translate it into the new language. Also add the 4
lines to remember from which version this file was translated.


--> FINALLY <--

That's it, the Jmol website should now be ready to be accessible in a new language.
Build it on your PC (I hope you already built it during the translation process
to check your translation ;).
If you want to test each web page separately, just open them in your favorite
browser from your local drive. Note: most of the links won't work, you'll need to
install a web server to make them work. Sorry, but you'll have to find yourself
how to install and configure a web server on your system.


--> KEEPING THE TRANSLATION UP TO DATE <--

The Jmol documentation will evolve, and the translations will need to be updated.
The comments (see the steps above) you put in the translated files will help to
update the translation. Using CVS, compare the current version of the English with
the version used in the previous translation (you have it in your comment :) ).
You will then have the modifications, translate them and don't forget to update
the comment with the version ;)
