<section title="Graphics Engine">
  <p>
    The Jmol graphics engine is a completely written in Java. There
    is no Java3D, OpenGL or any type of hardware acceleration.
  </p>
  <p>
    The graphics engine is a special purpose graphics engine,
    not a general purpose 3D graphics library.
    The rendering engine was built especially for displaying molecules,
    so it does a very good job of drawing spheres and cylinders.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is a completely software implementation of a z-buffer.
    There is a int[] pixelBuffer which holds ARGB values and a
    short[] zBuffer which holds the pixel depth at that point.
  </p>
  <p>
    During the repaint cycle, the entire scene is rendered into this
    pixelBuffer. Then the entire scene is draw as one image with a
    single Graphics.drawImage(...) operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    It does not use a display list of triangular meshes. That would be
    too slow. Instead, there are optimized routines for drawing spheres
    and cylinders.
