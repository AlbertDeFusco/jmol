<section title="What is the story on anti-aliasing?">
  <p>
    <i>Anti-aliasing is not currently enabled in Jmol. Most of the
    mechanism is in place, but is currently turned off. 
    It is currently disabled because of performance problems on older hardware.
    We plan to complete the implementation and re-enable it in a
    future release ... when we have a little more time to figure out how
    it should be handled on older machines.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
    The Jmol Graphics3D engine is implemented completely in software. It
    cannot use the underlying Sun 2D graphics calls because they do not offer
    the zBuffer functionality of deciding on a pixel-by-pixel basis whether or
    not a pixel should be drawn.
  </p>

  <p>
    The anti-aliasing technique used in the Jmol Graphics3D engine is called
    full-scene-anti-aliasing. The entire scene is rendered into a buffer that
    is twice as wide and twice as high. Then, 4 pixels are converted into 1
    pixel, with appropriate mixing of RGB values.
  </p>

  <p>
    The end result is that it takes more memory to hold the zBuffer and
    pixelBuffer. And it takea lot more CPU cycles to render a scene. The
    drawing part takes 4 times as long. Overall, it probably takes 3 times as
    long to render a scene.
  </p>

  <p>
    On newer machines with lots of CPU power this is probably not a problem.
    On older machines it would be unacceptable.   
    Therefore, we need to put in some options.
