  <section title="Can Jmol be displayed in my language?">
    <p>
      Yes, likely! 
      Jmol is a fully <b><i>internationalised</i></b> program (meaning that it can 
      adapt its interface to be displayed in one of several languages) 
      and it has been <b><i>localised</i></b> (meaning that there 
      are several translations available and built into the program).
    </p>
    <p>
    Check 
    <a href="http://wiki.jmol.org:81/index.php/Internationalisation/Current_Status">the Wiki</a>
    for the list of currently supported languages.
    </p>
    <p>
    If your language is in the list, Jmol should automatically open
    using it. If it doesn't, either the language you want is not your operating system
    language (which is the one Jmol will choose), or something is failing 
    (but this is uncommon).
    You can force Jmol into using any of the available languages in several ways:    
    </p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Upon start: visit <a href="http://wiki.jmol.org:81/index.php/Jmol_Application#Forcing_Jmol_to_open_in_a_certain_language">this Wiki page</a>
    	for instructions.
    	</li>
    	<li>Dynamically after Jmol has started:
		using the 'Language' entry near the bottom of the pop-up menu.
		Please, don't change language many times, as Jmol may lock.
		You can also do it from the console, using the 'language' command; 
		see link above for details.
		</li>    	
    </ul>
    <p>
    If your language is <b>not</b> in the list, you may volunteer to collaborate
    as translator. Please, read instructions in
    <a href="http://wiki.jmol.org:81/index.php/Internationalisation">this Wiki page</a>
    and, if you need help, contact the developers team.
