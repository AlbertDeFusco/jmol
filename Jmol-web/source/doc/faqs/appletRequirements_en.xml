      Jmol runs fine on the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine.
      However, Microsoft stopped shipping it in 2002 (?).
      Since Microsoft no longer really supports this product,
      we strongly recommend that you upgrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you understand enough to ask this question, the you
      should understand that you should upgrade.

  <section title="What is the deal with MacOS X?">
    <p>
      Only Mac OS X 10.3.3 and greater with Safari v125.1
      are supported.
      Up to that point there was no LiveConnect communication between
      JavaScript and Java applets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Internet Explorer on Mac OS X <i>not</i> supported
      because it does not support LiveConnect communications.

      Are you running on a <i>supported</i> browser?
    </p>
    <p>
      To check your browser try out the
      <a href="../browsercheck">Jmol Browser Check</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The underlying JmolApplet runs on many browsers.
      Unfortunately, many of those browsers do not support LiveConnect
      communications between JavaScript and Java. So if the web pages use
      JavaScript to try to control the JmolApplet, then it will not work
      on those browsers.
    </p>

      A partial list:
      <ul>
	<li>Anything on MacOS X prior to 10.3.3 with Java 1.4.2</li>
	<li>IE on Mac OS X</li>
	<li>
	  Mozilla/Netscape on OS X<br />
	  <i>unless you have the javaplugin installed</i>
	</li>
      </ul>

  <section title="The buttons are not working on Mozilla/Firefox on MacOS X">
    <p>
      By default Mozilla/Firefox will use Java 1.3 ... and there
      is no support for LiveConnect communication between JavaScript and Java. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You must install the MacOS X java plugin from 
      <a href="http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net">javaplugin.sourceforge.net</a>

   title="Is OpenGL or 3D hardware required to run the JmolApplet?">
    <p>
      No special hardware is required to run the JmolApplet.
      The graphics engine is a z-buffer implemented in Java,
      and designed for rendering molecules. <i>(In fact, designed
      just for Jmol.)</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a good graphics card then it will run faster,
      but it doesn't have anything to do with the 3D capabilities
      of the card.
