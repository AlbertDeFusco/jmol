      It does not use any Java graphics calls. The entire
      image is built offscreen and sent to the screen with one
      java.awt.Graphics.drawImage operation.

    <ul>
      <li>Get a faster machine ... something built this century</li>
      <li>Convince Sun to fix graphics performance problems</li>
      <li>Review the source code and find some way to speed it up</li>

  <section title="Will a 3D graphics card improve performance?">
    <p>
      A high-performance graphics card will certainly help.
      The underlying system spends a lot of time blitting 32-bit
      RGB bitmaps to the screen. But no 3D capabilities of the card
      will be used.

    <p>
      Twice as many pixels means twice as much work ... and if your
      applet is twice as wide and twice as high then you have 4 times
      as many pixels so you get 1/4 the speed.
