  <section title="How are the graphics different in Jmol v10?">
    <p>
      A new 3D graphics engine has been developed for Jmol v10 to
      properly support intersecting shapes. This is important
      when viewing spacefilled molecular models.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 3D engine also has much higher performance when dealing
      with larger molecules.

  <section title="I see jaggies. Why aren't the graphics anti-aliased?">
    <p>
      No java graphics calls are used in the construction of the image.
      The entire scene is constructed in memory and transferred to the
      screen with one drawImage operation. <br />
      Hey ... aren't you the person who was complaining about speed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent (v11) versions of Jmol allow to use antialiasing,
      both for the display and for exported images. Check out

    <p>
      Export from the application to POV-Ray, or
      <br />
      increase the size of the application window, or
      <br />
      learn how to open Jmol in even larger sizes and export images 
      without display, using the command line.

  <section title="Does Jmol support isosurfaces?">
    <p>
      Yes. Starting with version 10.2, Jmol has some functionality
      for rendering isosurfaces,
      that is greatly expanded on version 11.0.
