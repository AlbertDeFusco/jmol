# Crystalline silicon : computation of the total energy
# Convergence with respect to the number of k points.


#Definition of the k-point grids

                  # into account the symmetry
nshiftk 4

        0.5 0.0 0.0
        0.0 0.5 0.0
        0.0 0.0 0.5

#Definition of the unit cell

#Definition of the atom types
ntype 1           # There is only one type of atom
zatnum 14         # The keyword "zatnum" refers to the atomic number of the 
                  # possible type(s) of atom. The pseudopotential(s) 
                  # mentioned in the "files" file must correspond
                  # to the type(s) of atom. Here, the only type is Silicon.
                         

#Definition of the atoms
natom 2           # There are two atoms
type 1 1          # They both are of type 1, that is, Silicon.
xred              # This keyword indicate that the location of the atoms
                  # will follow, one triplet of number for each atom
   0.0  0.0  0.0     # Triplet giving the REDUCED coordinate of atom 1.
   0.25 0.25 0.25    # Triplet giving the REDUCED coordinate of atom 2.

#Definition of the planewave basis set
ecut  8.0         # Maximal kinetic energy cut-off, in Hartree

#Definition of the SCF procedure
nstep 10          # Maximal number of SCF cycles
toldfe 1.0d-6     # Will stop when, twice in a row, the difference 
                  # between two consecutive evaluations of total energy 
                  # differ by less than toldfe (in Hartree) 
diemac 12.0       # Although this is not mandatory, it is worth to
                  # precondition the SCF cycle. The model dielectric
                  # function used as the standard preconditioner
                  # is described in the "dielng" input variable section.
                  # Here, we follow the prescription for bulk silicon.
