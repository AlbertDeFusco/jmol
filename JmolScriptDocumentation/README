HOWTO create the UserGuide Script Command Overview in DocBook

1. Get a XML version of the online documentation by Bob Hanson:

http://www.stolaf.edu/people/hansonr/jmol/docs/?xml

and save this as tmp.xml

Konqueror seems to fail on the JavaScript now, but FireFox (1.0.6)
is seems supposed to work.

2. Convert this to DocBook XML source code:

The XML output is dirty, and needs to be cleaned up first:

xmllint --recover tmp.xml > source.xml

xsltproc sheet.xsl source.xml  > target.xml

3. Copy target.xml to the Jmol tree:

cp target.xml Jmol/doc/source/guide/scriptCommands.docbook.xml
