Complete(?) list of new Jmol script/JavaScript functionality planned for 11.4 and 
introduced in prereleases 11.3.x.

See http://www.stolaf.edu/academics/chemapps/jmol/docs for details. Some of these 
commands are not documented because they are intended for serialization only -- for the
construction of a Jmol script describing the precise state of the applet or application.
