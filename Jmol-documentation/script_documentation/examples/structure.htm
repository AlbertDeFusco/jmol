," The secondary structure of proteins and nucleic acids can be more easily visualized using a variety of graphical objects. These may be best viewed if the wireframe is turned off. Note that \"rockets\" are for proteins only, not nucleic acids. All of these objects have a \"radius\" that can be set when they are turned on. The number of parallel strands can also be set using the <i>set strands n</i> command."
