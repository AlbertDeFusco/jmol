," There are four principal adjustments you can make to the lighting effects in Jmol. Try different combinations for effect."
," <b>specular</b> Sets the size of the apparent reflection from a light source. <i>set specular 0</i> turns off this effect."
	,"set specular 0 ~~ set specular 20 ~~ set specular 40 ~~ set specular 60 ~~ set specular 100"
," <b>specpower</b> Sets the density of dots in the specular reflection."
	,"set specpower 0 ~~ set specpower 20 ~~ set specpower 40 ~~ set specpower 60 ~~ set specpower 100"
,' <b>ambient</b> Sets the amount of "ambient" light filling the shadows created by the apparent light source. An ambient value of 0 creates an effect of a spotlight on a stage; a value of 100 removes the shadow entirely, creating a flat, nonrealistic effect.'
	,"set ambient 0 ~~ set ambient 20 ~~ set ambient 40 ~~ set ambient 60 ~~ set ambient 100"
,' <b>diffuse</b> Sets the amount of "diffuse" light apparently emanating from the spotlight, but not hitting and reflecting off the model directly. Setting the diffuse value to 0 turns this effect off; giving the effect of the model in a black-walled room where no light reflection is possible, effectively turning off all shadows.'
	,"set diffuse 0 ~~ set diffuse 20 ~~ set diffuse 40 ~~ set diffuse 60 ~~ set diffuse 100"
